For this repository, I have included a link to my excel worksheet for the file named multi_year_stock_data where I was able to calculate the data for all 4 quarters of the given data. I also used conditional formatting to color coordinate my first quarter as specified in the instructions. I have also attatched screenshots for my results and have included a README file to this repository.
